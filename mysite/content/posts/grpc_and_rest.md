# RPC
RPC is protocol. everybody thinks it's a design pattern. wtf.
anyway.
## pros
simple and easy to understand
lightweight payloads
high performance
## cons
tight coupling
no discoverability
function explosion (overlapping, no versioning)

# REST
representation state transfer
it's an architechtual style
strong goal of decoupling
we model resources instead of functions.
we have entry points instead of lists of functions
## pros
decoupled client and server
API can evolve over time
reuses http
## cons
no single spec
big payloads and chattiness

# GraphQL
## pros
low network overhead
typed schema
fits graph-like data very well
## cons
complexity
caching
versioning
still early

# gRPC
http/2
protobuf serialization (pluggable)
clients open long-lived connection a grpc server
    a new http/2 stream for each RPC call
    alllows simultaneous in-flight RPC calls
allws client-side and server-side streaming
## cons
Load balancing
Error hadling is really bad
Breaking API changes
Poor documentation for some languages
No standardization across languages

We had RPC before!
CORBA, DCOM, RMI, SOAP
SOAP is the first rpc which is interopable
cause they use XML

# Notes
# Preface. Origin of RPC and formal definitions of surrounding concepts.
I spent the last week accumulating knowleadge on RPC stuff.
Let me remind you that we had a short meeting on 30th of May which lead us to understaing that we do need RPC
to have block explorer app up and running as well as bunch of other stuff.
Math teaches us before we're working with some kind of object, structure or abstraction we must have a formal
definition of this thing. Having a format definition is essential for deep understanding of any domain.
Knowing what an abstraction exactly is eliminates possibily of misunderstanding. Language is always a concensus based tool. Let's have a concensus then!
Let's all of us agree on what do we mean when we say an RPC acronym. Acronyms are easy, huh? Basically knowing what each letter of a word stands for
give you an insignt on what the word means for free. 
RPC stands for remote procedure call. So it's a call of a remote procedure. It might be calls of remote procedure as well. Say honestly can you explain what
RPC is after knowing what are call, remote and procedure. I bet you can't.
When I had been assigned to do a presentation on RPC for you guys the first thing I thought was "hey stop right here, what rpc exactly is" and the most accesable
and easy way to get something is to look up in a dictionary or
being reallistic for computer science term it's more convinient to type `rpc wiki` in a search bar and hit enter.
What I found on wikipedia from my point of view is a disaster.
Let me remind you that words' meaning is also context based. For example the word `call` as a noun in American English has 4 different possible contexts and
5 different meanings according to the cambridge dictionary.
So it's necessary to understand the exact meaning for terms you use depending on a context.
You might argue that in computer science all terms are independent on a context.
The first example which pops up in my head is a pointer. So what is a pointer in C and C++ programming languages?
1. In C and C++ pointers are variables that store addresses and can be null.
Then what is smart pointer?
2. Smart pointer is an abstract data type that simulates a pointer while providing added features.
Can abstract data type simulate a variable?
No, of course it can not. Even though a type word has a bunch of meaning from mathematics to computer science to fashion
I bet that there's no meaning of that word which can be used in a context of being simulated by an abstract data type.
3. In C and C++ pointer is a class of types (eg int*, void*) which represents a position of an object in memory
   while also being able to represent no position (nullptr).

I'm quoting it
'In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is
when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute
in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network),
which is coded as if it was a normal (local) procedure call,
without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction.'
Why is it a disaster?
I'd like to ask you why do you think I wasn't satisfied with the given definition.

The first problem with the definition above is that you can't say what rpc is after reading the definition of it.
I mean you can repeat what you've just heard but it makes no sence. Why do I say that and how's it different for the good definitions.
The 2 definitions of the C/C++ pointers are good enough and let me show you the difference and why do I think they're better than rpc wiki definition.
- In C and C++ pointers are variables that store addresses and can be null.
What is a pointer?
First of all a pointer is a variable.
Is it just any variable?
No, it must store addresses or be null.
So we have an object and constraints on an object
The same goes for the second definition.
- In C and C++ pointer is a class of types (int*, void*) which represents a position of an object in memory
   while also being able to represent no position (nullptr).
What is a pointer?
First of all a pointer is a class of types
Which class of types?
Class means some restrictions so you might wonder which class is that and it's easy to answer
that pointer must represents a position of an object in memory.
This is clear.
I'm quoting again rpc definition.
'In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is
when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute
in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network),
which is coded as if it was a normal (local) procedure call,
without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction.'
What's rpc?
I don't know. If you don't have a prior knowleadge you can't answer the question just using that definition.
Definitions which start with the word *when* are destructive and considered to be harmful for the deep understanding of a subject.
Originaly the word RPC stood for an extension of procedure call.
The difference is that an actual execution must happen on a remote machine or at least in a different address space.
So the original definition of RPC sounds like
A remote procedure call is a procedure call that's executed in a different address space.
Thus we can answer the question what's rpc.
Firstly it's a procedure call.
Is in any procedure call?
No, it must be executed in a different address space.
Awesome! Now we all know what rpc is. Well, not really.
In reallity nobody still uses rpc as a word which was used almost 50 years ago.
So let me explain what rpc means nowadays.
RPC is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating APIs.
It's important to notice that people often omit the word `implementation` when they actually mean it.
For example even though ReST is an approach, style and just a list of constraints for implementing web applications
we can say that a service has rest or rest api and what we actually mean is that a service has an implementation of rest api.
It has an implementation of API according to the specific style and which abides the rules.

Even though being a human means we would probably omit the impelementation word
partialy because the use of it is redundant and can be
deducted from a context now we have a clear understaing what rpc implementation means.
You might think that the definition is too vague and you still don't really get what's the
difference between ReST and RPC. RPC and ReST are essentially the same at least because they
solve the same problem in software engineering. If we dived into details we'd see the difference.
That's what're we going to do right now.
As you can see the origin of rpc is an attempt to isolate processes and create virtual memory
abstraction to achive different kinds of goals. Once computers evolved enough we don't see a problem of
processes isolation that vivid anymore and basically take for granted that procedures can be executed in different
address spaces. The legacy that rpc brings to us is that rpc means to be as simple as possible
and creating abstraction on top of application is not requered. Therefore the guildline of rpc
is to be tightly coupled with the internal app.
On the other hand RESTful web services have loosly coupled API implementations.
A bit of history of ReST.
`The term representational state transfer was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation.
Fielding's dissertation explained the REST principles that were known as the "HTTP object model" beginning in 1994,
and were used in designing the HTTP 1.1 and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) standards.
The term is intended to evoke an image of how a well-designed Web application behaves:
it is a network of Web resources (a virtual state-machine) where the user progresses
through the application by selecting resource identifiers such as http://www.example.com/articles/21
and resource operations such as GET or POST (application state transitions),
resulting in the next resource's representation (the next application state) being transferred to the end user for their use.`
The concept is aiming to indeed create a loosly coupled architecture and what else is that such a design style makes
sense when you want to create a lot of reuseble components so that a client side could create another application on top 
of the api by combining those components. There's a bunch of other architectural constraints which REST introduces however i hope
that you got the main idea.
Congratulations now we know some basics of rpc and REST.
It's enough to be pedantic and let's move on.

# gRPC
GRPC uses HTTP2 at the transport layer which is a multiplexing wire protocol,
this comes with a framing overhead but provides a variety of benefits at the same time
(flow-control, mid-stream cancellation, no need to open many sockets which avoids exploding TLS negotiation costs and saves file descriptors.

# gRPC alternatives
Twirp (also uses protobuf) -- no C++ support
Apache Thrift is a huge project and it's more flexible than grpc.
It supports 4 different protocols, 5 transports and a huge project in general.
Both candidates are good options.
grpc has API reference for C++ language.

# Protocol buffer as DSL. gRPC and Apache Thrift. Demo in C++.

Best practicies from grpc:
Protocol Buffers and O-O Design Protocol buffer classes are basically dumb
data holders (like structs in C); they don't make good first class citizens in an object model.
If you want to add richer behaviour to a generated class, the best way to do this is to wrap
the generated protocol buffer class in an application-specific class. Wrapping protocol buffers
is also a good idea if you don't have control over the design of the .proto file
(if, say, you're reusing one from another project). In that case, you can use the
wrapper class to craft an interface better suited to the unique environment of
your application: hiding some data and methods, exposing convenience functions, etc.
You should never add behaviour to the generated classes by inheriting from them.
This will break internal mechanisms and is not good object-oriented practice anyway.
