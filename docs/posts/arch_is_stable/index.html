<p>As you might notice after reading <a href="/../about">the about me page</a>, I have the macbook and don't run macos.
It's not a popular choice and folks around keep saying that macos is unix or unix-like system
and has everything you need including tools for development purpose. It's kinda true and most of the tools are available.
Despite of that I faced a number of issues with software not being able to compile for macos on macos.
I haven't tracked any of those issues and barely remember any them. You just have to believe me on that one. And for anyone wondering, yes, I can read readmes and follow the steps. I do know how to update software on macos and install missing packages or the right version of them. So I'm sure it wasn't a me problem.</p>
<p>Another reason of switching is that I've been following the development of <a href="https://swaywm.org/">sway wm</a> for a whlie
and therefore had a desire on get my hands on this window manager and give <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">wayland</a> a try.</p>
<p>The idea behind this post is to log issues that occured during my usage of the system. It's not a problem &ndash; solution type of reading. The only thing you might get from this post is to see when I had bad days. The post has no date and is aimed to be updated on regular basis.</p>
