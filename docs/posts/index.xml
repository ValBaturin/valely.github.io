      <description>Upcoming features in Haskell   Researchers who study some technique X ask themselves how best to use X to do Y, and publish a series of papers on the subject, but practitioners don&#39;t care about the answer to that question because they don&#39;t care about that question at all.
 Drew on rust   Yes, Rust is more safe. I don’t really care. In light of all of these problems, I’ll take my segfaults and buffer overflows.</description>

      <description>Before you get started I assume that a fellow reader has some understanding of APIs and experience with REST, in particular, might help as well. The goal of this post is to provide a clear understanding of RPC. You might&#39;ve already worked with gRPC or Apache Thrift but still can&#39;t elaborate on the differences between REST API and the mentioned tech. This post is exactly for you.

      <description>As you might notice after reading the about me page, I have the macbook and don&#39;t run macos. It&#39;s not a popular choice and folks around keep saying that macos is unix or unix-like system and has everything you need including tools for development purpose. It&#39;s kinda true and most of the tools are available. Despite of that I faced a number of issues with software not being able to compile for macos on macos.</description>
